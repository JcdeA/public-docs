# Service Features
Many projects ask what they can expect with their service; more specifically, what bells and whistles are included with our service. We have written this guide to help potential and existing projects to consider some of the unique features of our service:

- [x] Full root console access to your instances;
- [x] Offsite backups;
- [x] Third-line support is available for your instance (we do not provide everyday hand holding);
- [x] Reverse DNS (rDNS/PTR);
- [x] IPv4 and / or IPv6; and
- [x] Domain Registration and holding services.

We provide these services in addition to what you would expect from a [standard virtual instance](/general/getting-started#production-services). This allows projects to benefit from our diversified and decentralized infrastructure.

From time to time, we may advertise different services, for particularly large, or complex requirements.  These features will be discussed with you privately.
